# PyFrac
A python implementation of a generic fractal flame generator.

The major feature of this project is the fracpoints function, which creates a structured x,y,color array of points corresponding to a desired coefficient set. This set represents a fractal flame, with many coefficient sets forming pleasant recursive images. It contains support for post-generation variations and color blending variations.

This project contains a small list of popular coefficient sets, such as the Sierpinski triangle. It also contains a simple function to programmatically generate randomized sets for inspection and image generation.

Included in this project is an example of utilizing the fractal engine to create visuals using the popular Python module MatPlotLib. The example creates colorful exponential curves and emulates a retro screensaver effect. While not a particularly robust or efficient system, it demonstrates a potential use case of this module.
